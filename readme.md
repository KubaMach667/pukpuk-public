## ðŸ’¡ The idea
We built a mobile app which lets users find and post job offerings and services near them. With PukPuk we aimed to create an app which would bring communities together.
It also posed a challenge for us as we wanted to use frameworks and solutions which we haven't used before. The non-coding work on PukPuk included designing the logo and the color scheme.

## ðŸ’» Tech stack

## ðŸ“±   The App
The app consists of three main screens: offer, map and earn. 
The layout can bee seen at https://imgur.com/a/3jfIbnr.
Designing and coding PukPuk from scratch took 2 months and we were responsible for every step of the process.
